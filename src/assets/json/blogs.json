Writing can be a powerful tool for organizing one's thoughts, so hopefully, by writing down my reflections, I'll be able to untangle my mind a bit.",

Whether it's the latest trends in ux, emerging technologies, or cute animal pictures, I hope to provide some interesting and engaging content. This portfolio is my digital home and I hope you have fun exploring it. feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or reach out over email",

            "text1": "RecipeFetcher was a school assignment I completed in March of this year. Built using TheMealDB API and Material UI, it was one of the first React web applications I created. The goal was to design a user-friendly app where users can search for recipes and filter by categories, making meal planning much easier. The experience taught me the fundamentals of API integration, state management, and responsive UI design. It was an eye-opening introduction to the power of React and Material UI, both of which I continue to use in my development workflow today.",
            "text2": "DrinkPedia, on the other hand, was a personal project I took on in July. I wanted to build something fun while also leveling up my skills. DrinkPedia fetches data from TheCocktailDB and was built using Chakra UI, a React component library that I found to be more flexible for custom UI needs. This project was a significant milestone for me because I was able to apply everything I had learned from RecipeFetcher while also experimenting with the design much more.",
            "end": "Itâ€™s been rewarding to see how far Iâ€™ve come in such a short time, from working on a school project to building something entirely on my own. With RecipeFetcher, I focused heavily on following best practices and following the assignment. But with DrinkPedia, I had more freedom to design and architect the application the way I wanted. Both projects can be found on my GitHub link in nav.",
